# README CYOSS Hire Challenge V2:

- Download ZIP file 

- Unpack the ZIP and Import the OVA to VirtualBox or VMware

- The box will gather an IP from DHCP, works with virtualbox & vmware.

- Do not cheat by using the virtualization to gain root access.

- Do not get the root flag through a recovery iso etc.

- The idea is to get root by attacking this machine remotely 
over a network with no physical access.


Objectives:

1) 	Find all flags - flags have the format flag{string}
	Flags do not contain any hints how to proceed.

2) 	The goal is to gain root privileges

3) 	Consider it over when reading /root/final.txt and follow the instructions

4) 	Document your steps made, tools used, commands fired and all the information gathered during this challenge in a short text file.

5) 	Send us an email with this text file and discovered flags (email address is in the final flag)


Have Fun!
   &
Good Luck!
