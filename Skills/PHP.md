# Setup & Tools
## Composer as equivalent to pip
use download_composer.sh to download
## Psysh as equivalent to Ipython
Does not work via Git
    - git clone https://github.com/bobthecow/psysh.git
    - in psysh: composer install
Works:
composer require psy/psysh:@stable

#TODO
PsySH file copied to /bin works as expected but if I delete folder vendor from command above it breaks

# MISC

.php
